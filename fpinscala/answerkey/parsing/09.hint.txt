For the tokens of your grammar, it's often a good idea to skip any trailing whitespace, to avoid having to deal with whitespace everywhere in your grammar. Try introducing a combinator for this. 

When sequencing parsers with `**`, it's common to want to ignore one of the parsers in the sequence, and you'll probably want to introduce combinators for this.
