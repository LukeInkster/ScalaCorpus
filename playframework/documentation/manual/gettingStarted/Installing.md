# Installing Play

This page shows how to download, install and run a Play application.  There's a built in tutorial that shows you around, so running this Play application will show you how Play itself works!

## Prerequisites

Play requires Java 1.8.  To check that you have the latest JDK, please run:

```bash
java -version
```

If you don't have the JDK, you have to install it from [Oracle's JDK Site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

## Installing Play

Play is a series of libraries available in [Maven Repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.typesafe.play), so you can use any Java build tool to build a Play project.

For getting started, we'll install Play through [Lightbend Activator](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/docs).

Activator can be described as "sbt plus templates" -- it combines [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/index.html) (a build tool) plus a means of downloading [project templates](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/templates) (like Maven archetypes) and a web interface for managing those projects.  Templates can be examples, or they can be "seed" templates that provide a starting point for your own projects.

Activator comes with a couple of seed templates for Play that we recommend for getting started, [play-scala](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/play-scala) and [play-java](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/play-java).

### Downloading Activator

Activator is distributed as a single archive file that expands out to its own subdirectory.

You can download Activator from [https://playframework.com/download](https://playframework.com/download) and click on the "offline distribution" link:

The "offline distribution" comes with all of Activator's possible dependencies included.  It's a much larger initial download, but installing the offline distribution means that starting up a new Play project is **much** faster, as all the dependencies are already resolved.

### Extracting Activator

Extract the archive on a location where you have write access.  Running `activator` writes some files to directories within the distribution, so don't install to `/opt`, `/usr/local` or anywhere else youâ€™d need special permission to write to.

### Adding Activator to your Path

For convenience, you should add the Activator installation directory to your system `PATH`:

#### MacOS / Unix

Add to your login profile.  Usually, this is `$HOME/.profile`:

```
export PATH=/path/to/activator-x.x.x:$PATH
```

Make sure that the `activator` script is executable. If it's not:

```
chmod u+x /path/to/activator-x.x.x/activator
```

#### Windows

In a command prompt, type:

```
setx PATH=%PATH%;"C:\path\to\activator-x.x.x\bin"
```

Note that [setx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755104.aspx) is only available on Windows 8 or later -- before that, and you will have to use the [System Properties dialog](https://java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).

## Create a Project

Activator comes with a couple of different "seeds" that can be used to start off a Play project: `play-java` and `play-scala`.  You can create a project based off a template either from Activator's Web Interface, or directly from the command line.

Open a command prompt, and type `activator ui` to bring up the GUI interface.  A browser window will open with the Web UI at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

> **Note:** If you're behind a proxy, make sure to define it with `set HTTP_PROXY=http://<host>:<port>` on Windows or `export  HTTP_PROXY=http://<host>:<port>` on UNIX.

Follow the arrows to create a new project:

You can read the [Activator documentation](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/docs) for more information on how to use the Web Interface.

## Accessing the Built-in Tutorial

Activator's Web Interface contains a built in tutorial section that will walk you through your new application:

## Running Play

Play has an easy to use "development mode" that will let you make changes to code and see your results immediate on the page.

You can run Play in development mode from within Activator's Web Interface by going to the Run tab and clicking the Run button:

This will bring up the Play application at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

## Congratulations!

You are now ready to work with Play!  The next page will show you how to create projects from the command line and some more detail about creating new applications.
