# Debugging SSL Connections

In the event that an HTTPS connection does not go through, debugging JSSE can be a hassle.

WS SSL provides configuration options that will turn on JSSE debug options defined in the [Debugging Utilities](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Debug) and  [Troubleshooting Security](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/troubleshooting-security.html) pages.

To configure, set the `play.ws.ssl.debug` property in `application.conf`:

```
play.ws.ssl.debug = {
    # Turn on all debugging
    all = false
    # Turn on ssl debugging
    ssl = false
    # Turn certpath debugging on
    certpath = false
    # Turn ocsp debugging on
    ocsp = false
    # Enable per-record tracing
    record = false
    # hex dump of record plaintext, requires record to be true
    plaintext = false
    # print raw SSL/TLS packets, requires record to be true
    packet = false
    # Print each handshake message
    handshake = false
    # Print hex dump of each handshake message, requires handshake to be true
    data = false
    # Enable verbose handshake message printing, requires handshake to be true
    verbose = false
    # Print key generation data
    keygen = false
    # Print session activity
    session = false
    # Print default SSL initialization
    defaultctx = false
    # Print SSLContext tracing
    sslctx = false
    # Print session cache tracing
    sessioncache = false
    # Print key manager tracing
    keymanager = false
    # Print trust manager tracing
    trustmanager = false
    # Turn pluggability debugging on
    pluggability = false
}
```

> **Note:** This feature changes the setting of the `java.net.debug` system property which is global on the JVM.  In addition, this feature [changes static properties at runtime](https://tersesystems.com/2014/03/02/monkeypatching-java-classes/), and is only intended for use in development environments.

## Verbose Debugging

To see the behavior of WS SSL, you can configure the SLF4J logger `play.api.libs.ws.ssl` for debug output.  For example, if you are using Logback, in `conf/logback.xml` you would configure:

```
<logger name="play.api.libs.ws.ssl" value="DEBUG"/>
```

## Dynamic Debugging

If you are working with WSClient instances created dynamically, you can use the `SSLDebugConfig` class to set up debugging using a builder pattern:

```
val debugConfig = SSLDebugConfig().withKeyManager().withHandshake(data = true, verbose = true)
```
