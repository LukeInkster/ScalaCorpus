# Handling file upload

## Uploading files in a form using `multipart/form-data`

The standard way to upload files in a web application is to use a form with a special `multipart/form-data` encoding, which allows mixing of standard form data with file attachments. Please note: the HTTP method for the form has to be POST (not GET).

Start by writing an HTML form:

```
@form(action = routes.Application.upload, 'enctype -> "multipart/form-data") {

    <input type="file" name="picture">

    <p>
        <input type="submit">
    </p>

}
```

Now letâ€™s define the `upload` action:

@[syncUpload](code/JavaFileUpload.java)

## Direct file upload

Another way to send files to the server is to use Ajax to upload files asynchronously from a form. In this case, the request body will not be encoded as `multipart/form-data`, but will just contain the plain file contents.

@[asyncUpload](code/JavaFileUpload.java)
