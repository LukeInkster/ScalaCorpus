# Handling file upload

## Uploading files in a form using multipart/form-data

The standard way to upload files in a web application is to use a form with a special `multipart/form-data` encoding, which lets you mix standard form data with file attachment data. 

> **Note:** The HTTP method used to submit the form must be `POST` (not `GET`).

Start by writing an HTML form:

@[file-upload-form](code/scalaguide/templates/views/uploadForm.scala.html)

Now define the `upload` action using a `multipartFormData` body parser:

@[upload-file-action](code/ScalaFileUpload.scala)

The `ref` attribute give you a reference to a `TemporaryFile`. This is the default way the `multipartFormData` parser handles file upload.

> **Note:** As always, you can also use the `anyContent` body parser and retrieve it as `request.body.asMultipartFormData`.

At last, add a `POST` router

## Direct file upload

Another way to send files to the server is to use Ajax to upload the file asynchronously in a form. In this case the request body will not have been encoded as `multipart/form-data`, but will just contain the plain file content.

In this case we can just use a body parser to store the request body content in a file. For this example, letâ€™s use the `temporaryFile` body parser:

@[upload-file-directly-action](code/ScalaFileUpload.scala)

## Writing your own body parser

If you want to handle the file upload directly without buffering it in a temporary file, you can just write your own `BodyParser`. In this case, you will receive chunks of data that you are free to push anywhere you want.

If you want to use `multipart/form-data` encoding, you can still use the default `multipartFormData` parser by providing a `FilePartHandler[A]` and using a different Sink to accumulate data.  For example, you can use a `FilePartHandler[File]` rather than a TemporaryFile by specifying an `Accumulator(fileSink)`:
