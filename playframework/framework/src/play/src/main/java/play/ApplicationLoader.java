/**
 * Loads an application.  This is responsible for instantiating an application given a context.
 *
 * Application loaders are expected to instantiate all parts of an application, wiring everything together. They may
 * be manually implemented, if compile time wiring is preferred, or core/third party implementations may be used, for
 * example that provide a runtime dependency injection framework.
 *
 * During dev mode, an ApplicationLoader will be instantiated once, and called once, each time the application is
 * reloaded. In prod mode, the ApplicationLoader will be instantiated and called once when the application is started.
 *
 * Out of the box Play provides a Java and Scala default implementation based on Guice. The Java implementation is the
 * {@link play.inject.guice.GuiceApplicationLoader} and the Scala implementation is {@link play.api.inject.guice.GuiceApplicationLoader}.
 *
 * A custom application loader can be configured using the `play.application.loader` configuration property.
 * Implementations must define a no-arg constructor.
