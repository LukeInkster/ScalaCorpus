# General Environment Variables

* `JAVA_OPTS`  Default: `-Xmx512m`
    Any options that should be passed to the JVM that marathon will run in.


# Marathon Command Line Flags

## Core Functionality

These flags control the core functionality of the Marathon server.


### Note - Command Line Flags May Be Specified Using Environment Variables

The core functionality flags can be also set by environment variable `MARATHON_OPTION_NAME` (the option name with a `MARATHON_` prefix added to it), for example `MARATHON_MASTER` for `--master` option.  Please note that command line options precede environment variables.  This means that if the `MARATHON_MASTER` environment variable is set and `--master` is supplied on the command line, then the environment variable is ignored.

### Required Flags

* `--master` (Required): The URL of the Mesos master. The format is a
    comma-delimited list of of hosts like `zk://host1:port,host2:port/mesos`.
    If using ZooKeeper, pay particular attention to the leading `zk://` and
    trailing `/mesos`! If not using ZooKeeper, standard URLs like
    `http://localhost` are also acceptable.

### Optional Flags

* `--artifact_store` (Optional. Default: None): URL to the artifact store.
    Examples: `"hdfs://localhost:54310/path/to/store"`,
    `"file:///var/log/store"`. For details, see the
    [artifact store]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/artifact-store.html) docs.
* `--access_control_allow_origin` (Optional. Default: None):
    Comma separated list of allowed originating domains for HTTP requests.
    The origin(s) to allow in Marathon. Not set by default.

## Tuning Flags for Offer Matching/Launching Tasks

Mesos frequently sends resource offers to Marathon (and all other frameworks). Each offer will represent the
available resources of a single node in the cluster. Before this <span class="label label-default">v0.8.2</span>,
Marathon would only start a single task per
resource offer, which led to slow task launching in smaller clusters.


### Marathon after 0.11.0 (including)

In order to speed up task launching and use the
resource offers Marathon receives from Mesos more efficiently, we added a new offer matching algorithm which tries
to start as many tasks as possible per task offer cycle. The maximum number of tasks to start on one offer is
configurable with the following startup parameters:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.8.2</span> `--max_tasks_per_offer` (Optional. Default: 5): Launch at most this
    number of tasks per Mesos offer. Usually,
    there is one offer per cycle and slave. You can speed up launching tasks by increasing this number.

To prevent overloading Mesos itself, you can also restrict how many tasks Marathon launches per time interval.
By default, we allow 100 unconfirmed task launches every 30 seconds. In addition, Marathon launches
more tasks when it gets feedback about running and healthy tasks from Mesos.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--launch_token_refresh_interval` (Optional. Default: 30000):
    The interval (ms) in which to refresh the launch tokens to `--launch_token_count`.
* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--launch_tokens` (Optional. Default: 100):
    Launch tokens per interval.

To prevent overloading Marathon and maintain speedy offer processing, there is a timeout for matching each
incoming resource offer, i.e. finding suitable tasks to launch for incoming offers.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--offer_matching_timeout` (Optional. Default: 1000):
    Offer matching timeout (ms). Stop trying to match additional tasks for this offer after this time.
    All already matched tasks are launched.

All launched tasks are stored before launching them. There is also a timeout for this:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--save_tasks_to_launch_timeout` (Optional. Default: 3000):
    Timeout (ms) after matching an offer for saving all matched tasks that we are about to launch.
    When reaching the timeout, only the tasks that we could save within the timeout are also launched.
    All other task launches are temporarily rejected and retried later.

If the Mesos master fails over or in other unusual circumstances, a launch task request might get lost.
You can configure how long Marathon waits for the first `TASK_STAGING` update.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--task_launch_confirm_timeout` (Optional. Default: 300000 (5 minutes)):
  Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a task to enter the `TASK_STAGING` state before killing it.

When the task launch requests in Marathon change because an app definition changes or a backoff delay is overdue,
Marathon can request all available offers from Mesos again -- even those that it has recently rejected. To avoid
calling the underlying `reviveOffers` API call to often, you can configure the minimal delay between subsequent
invocations of this call.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--min_revive_offers_interval` (Optional. Default: 5000):
    Do not ask for all offers (also already seen ones) more often than this interval (ms).

The order in which mesos receives `reviveOffers` and `declineOffer` calls is not guaranteed. Therefore, as
long as we still need offers to launch tasks, we repeat the `reviveOffers` call for `--revive_offers_repetitions`
times so that our last `reviveOffers` will be received after all relevant `declineOffer` calls with high
probability.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--revive_offers_repetitions` (Optional. Default: 3):
    Repeat every reviveOffer request this many times, delayed by the `--min_revive_offers_interval`.

If you want to disable calling reviveOffers (not recommended), you can use:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--disable_revive_offers_for_new_apps`

When Marathon has no current use for an offer, it will decline the offer for a configurable period. This period is
configurable. A short duration might lead to resource starvation for other frameworks if you run many frameworks
in your cluster. You should only need to reduce it if you use `--disable_revive_offers_for_new_apps`.

* `--decline_offer_duration` (Default: 120 seconds) The duration (milliseconds) for which to decline offers by default.


### Marathon after 0.8.2 (including) and before 0.11.0

In order to speed up task launching and use the
resource offers Marathon receives from Mesos more efficiently, we added a new offer matching algorithm which tries
to start as many tasks as possible per task offer cycle. The maximum number of tasks to start is configurable with
the following startup parameters:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.8.2</span> `--max_tasks_per_offer` (Optional. Default: 5): Launch at most this
    number of tasks per Mesos offer. Usually,
    there is one offer per cycle and slave. You can speed up launching tasks by increasing this number.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.8.2</span> `--max_tasks_per_offer_cycle` (Optional. Default: 1000): Launch at
    most this number of tasks per Mesos offer cycle.
    A larger value speeds up launching new tasks.
    Yet, choosing a too large value might overwhelm Mesos/Marathon with processing task updates.

**Example**

Given a cluster with 200 nodes and the default settings for task launching. If we want to start 2000 tasks, it would
take at least 10 cycles, because we are only starting 1 task per offer (and hence 200 per cycle), leading to a total maximum of 200. If we
change the `max_tasks_per_offer` setting to 10, we could start 1000 tasks per offer cycle (the default setting for
`max_tasks_per_offer_cycle`), reducing the necessary cycles to 2. If we also adjust the `max_tasks_per_offer_cycle `
to 2000, we could start all tasks in a single cycle (given we receive offers for all nodes).

**Important**

Starting too many tasks at once can lead to a higher number of status updates being sent to Marathon than it can
currently handle. We will improve the number of events Marathon can handle in a future version. A maximum of 1000
tasks has proven to be a good default for now. `max_tasks_per_offer` should be adjusted so that `NUM_MESOS_SLAVES *
max_tasks_per_offer == max_tasks_per_offer_cycle `. E.g. in a cluster of 200 nodes it should be set to 5.

## Web Site Flags

The Web Site flags control the behavior of Marathon's web site, including the user-facing site and the REST API. They are inherited from the
[Chaos](https://github.com/mesosphere/chaos) library upon which Marathon and its companion project [Chronos](https://github.com/mesos/chronos) are based.
