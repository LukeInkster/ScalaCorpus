# Authorization and Access Control

If you are using Marathon on DC/OS, you can define fine-grained access to applications by creating advanced ACL groups in your native Marathon instance. Advanced ACL groups provide multi-tenancy by isolating application teams as well as individual users. You can also control customized access to applications, for example, to provide read-only access.

This feature is only available in Marathon deployed with DC/OS. See [the DCOS docs](https://docs.mesosphere.com/administration/security-and-authentication/advanced-acl/) for this feature.
