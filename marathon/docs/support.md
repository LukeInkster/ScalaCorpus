# Getting Support for Marathon

Marathon is under constant development by the team at Mesosphere. The team keeps
an eye on questions in a few places.

### GitHub Issues
Issues and feature requests can be filed through the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues).
For all requests specific to the **Marathon UI**, we ask you to kindly supply
the [`gui`](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agui) label.

### Marathon Google Group

The
[**marathon-framework** Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/marathon-framework)
is where team and community members ask and answer longer, potentially open-ended
questions.

### Stack Overflow "marathon" tag

The
["**marathon**" Stack Overflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/marathon)
is for specific questions that can be solved with a small amount of code.

### Mesosphere UX Research

If you'd like to take part in design research and test new features in Marathon before they're released, please add your name to our [UX Research](http://uxresearch.mesosphere.com) list.
