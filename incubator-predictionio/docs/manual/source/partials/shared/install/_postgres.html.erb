Setting up [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) to work with PredictionIO.

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed. For Mac Users, [Homebrew](brew.sh) is recommended and can be used as

```
$ brew install postgresql
```
or on Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install postgresql-9.4 
```

Now that PostgreSQL is installed use the following comands

`$ createdb pio` 

If you get an error of the form `could not connect to server: No such file or directory`, then you must first start the server manually,:

`$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start`

Finally use the command:

`$ psql -c "create user pio with password 'pio'"

Your configuration  in `pio-env.sh` is now compatible to run with PostgreSQL.
