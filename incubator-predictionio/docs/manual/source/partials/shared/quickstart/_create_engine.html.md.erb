Now let's create a new engine called *<%= engine_name %>* by downloading the <%= template_name %>. Go to a directory where you want to put your engine and run the following:

```
$ pio template get PredictionIO/<%= template_repo %> <%= engine_name %>
$ cd <%= engine_name %>
```

A new directory *<%= engine_name %>* is created, where you can find the downloaded engine template.
