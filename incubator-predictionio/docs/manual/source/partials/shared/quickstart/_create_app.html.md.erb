You will need to create a new App in PredictionIO to store all the data of your app. The data collected will be used for machine learning modeling.

Let's assume you want to use this engine in an application named "MyApp1".  Run the following to create a new app "MyApp1":

```
$ pio app new MyApp1
```

You should find the following in the console output:

```
...
[INFO] [App$] Initialized Event Store for this app ID: 1.
[INFO] [App$] Created new app:
[INFO] [App$]       Name: MyApp1
[INFO] [App$]         ID: 1
[INFO] [App$] Access Key: 3mZWDzci2D5YsqAnqNnXH9SB6Rg3dsTBs8iHkK6X2i54IQsIZI1eEeQQyMfs7b3F
```

Note that *App ID**, **Access Key** are created for this App "MyApp1". You will need the **Access Key** when you collect data with EventServer for this App.

You can list all of the apps created its corresponding ID and Access Key by running the following command:

```
$ pio app list
```

You should see a list of apps created. For example:

```
[INFO] [App$]                 Name |   ID |                                                       Access Key | Allowed Event(s)
[INFO] [App$]               MyApp1 |    1 | 3mZWDzci2D5YsqAnqNnXH9SB6Rg3dsTBs8iHkK6X2i54IQsIZI1eEeQQyMfs7b3F | (all)
[INFO] [App$]               MyApp2 |    2 | io5lz6Eg4m3Xe4JZTBFE13GMAf1dhFl6ZteuJfrO84XpdOz9wRCrDU44EUaYuXq5 | (all)
[INFO] [App$] Finished listing 2 app(s).
