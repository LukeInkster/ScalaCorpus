Now you can build, train, and deploy the engine. First, make sure you are under the `<%= engine_name %>` directory.

```
$ cd <%= engine_name %>
```

### Engine.json

Under the directory, you should find an `engine.json` file; this is where you specify parameters for the engine.

WARNING: Modify this file to make sure the `appName` parameter match your **App Name** you created earlier (e.g. "MyApp1" if you follow the quickstart).

```
  ...
  "datasource": {
    "params" : {
      "appName": "MyApp1"
    }
  },
  ...
```

NOTE: You may see `appId` in engine.json instead, which means you are using old template. In this case, make sure the `appId` defined in the file match your **App ID**. Alternatively, you can download the latest version of the template or follow our [upgrade instructions](/resources/upgrade/#upgrade-to-0.9.2) to modify the template to use `appName` as parameter.
