title: Deploying an Engine
---

An engine must be **built** (i.e. `pio build`) and **trained** (i.e. `pio train`)  before it can be deployed as a web service.

WARNING: The engine server is not protected by authentication, and the instructions below assume deployment in a trusted environment. See the section [Deploying with AWS](/system/deploy-cloudformation/) for a production deployment example.

## Deploying an Engine the First Time

After you have [downloaded an Engine Template](/start/download/),  you can deploy it with these steps:

1. Run `pio app new **your-app-name-here**` and specify the `appName` used in the template's *engine.json* file (you can set it there to your preference).
2. Run `pio build` to update the engine
2. Run `pio train` to train a predictive model with training data
3. Run `pio deploy` to deploy the engine as a service

A deployed engine listens to port 8000 by default. Your application can [send query to retrieve prediction](/appintegration/) in real-time through the REST interface. 

**Note**: a new engine deployed as above will have no data to start with. Your engine may  come with a `data/` directory with some sample data that you can import, not all have this. Check the quickstart instructions for your template.

## Update Model with New Data

You probably want to update the trained predictive model with newly collected data regularly.
To do so, run the `pio train` and `pio deploy` commands again:

```
$ pio train
$ pio deploy
```

For example, if you want to re-train the model every day, you may add this to your *crontab*:

```
0 0 * * *   $PIO_HOME/bin/pio train; $PIO_HOME/bin/pio deploy
```
where *$PIO_HOME* is the installation path of PredictionIO. See [Retrain and Deploy Script](#retrain-and-deploy-script) below for a script ready for customization.


## Specify a Different Engine Port

By default, `pio deploy` deploys an engine on **port 8000**.

You can specify another port with an *--port* argument. For example, to deploy on port 8123

```
pio deploy --port 8123
```

You can also specify the binding IP with *--ip*, which is set to *localhost* if not specified. For example:

```
pio deploy --port 8123 --ip 1.2.3.4
```

## Retrain and Deploy Script

A retrain and deploy script is available [in the *examples/redeploy-script* directory](https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO/tree/develop/examples/redeploy-script).

To use the script, copy *local.sh.template* as *local.sh*, *redeploy.sh* as (say) *MyEngine_Redeploy_(production).sh* (Name of the script will appear as title of email) and put both files under the *scripts/* directory of your engine.
Then, modify the settings inside both file, filling in details like `PIO_HOME`, `LOG_DIR`, `TARGET_EMAIL`, `ENGINE_JSON` and others.
You need to do `pio build` once before using this script. This script only trains and deploys.
If `pio train` or `pio deploy` fails for some reason, the running engine stays put in most cases.
If engine is retrained and deployed successfully, the email sent will have *Normal* in the title so you can set filtering rules.

`mailutils` is used in this script. For Ubuntu, you can do `sudo update-alternatives --config mailx` and see if `/usr/bin/mail.mailutils` is selected.
If you are using a server that blocks email, you will need to use services like SendGrid.

This script does not guarantee no down time since at some point during `pio deploy` the original engine is shut down.
The down time is usually not more than a few seconds though it can be more.

The last thing to do is to add this to your *crontab*:

```
0 0 * * *   /path/to/script >/dev/null 2>/dev/null # mute both stdout and stderr to supress email sent from cron
```
