title: Comics Recommendation Demo
---

## Introduction

In this demo, we will show you how to build a Tinder-style web application (named "Tapster") recommending comics to users based on their likes/dislikes of episodes interactively.

The demo will use [Similar Product Template](https://docs.prediction.io/templates/similarproduct/quickstart/). Similar Product Template is a great choice if you want to make recommendations based on immediate user activities or for new users with limited history. It uses MLLib Alternating Least Squares (ALS) recommendation algorithm, a [Collaborative filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Collaborative_filtering) (CF) algorithm commonly used for recommender systems. These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix. Users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries. A layman's interpretation of Collaborative Filtering is "People who like this comic, also like these comics."

All the code and data is on GitHub at: [github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster).

### Data
The source of the data is from [Tapastic](http://tapastic.com/). You can find the data files [here](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster/tree/master/data).

The data structure looks like this:

[Episode List](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster/blob/master/data/episode_list.csv) `data/episode_list.csv`

**Fields:** episodeId | episodeTitle | episodeCategories | episodeUrl | episodeImageUrls

1,000 rows. Each row represents one episode.

[User Like Event List](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster/blob/master/data/user_list.csv) `data/user_list.csv`

**Fields:** userId | episodeId | likedTimestamp

192,587 rows. Each row represents one user like for the given episode.

The tutorial has four major steps:
- Demo application setup
- PredictionIO installation and setup
- Import data into database and PredictionIO
- Integrate demo application with PredictionIO

## Tapster Demo Application
The demo application is built using Rails.

You can clone the existing application with:

```
$ git clone  https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster.git
$ cd Demo-Tapster
$ bundle install
```
You will need to edit `config/database.yml` to match your local database settings. We have provided some sensible defaults for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

Setup the database with:

```
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
```

At this point, you should have the demo application ready but with an empty database. Lets import the episodes data into our database. We will do this with: `$ rake import:episodes`. An "Episode" is a single [comic strip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_strip).

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster/blob/master/lib/tasks/import/episodes.rake)

This script is pretty simple. It loops through the CSV file and creates a new episode for each line in the file in our local database.

You can start the app and point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```
$rails server
```

## PredictionIO Setup

### Install PredictionIO
Follow the installation instructions [here](http://docs.prediction.io/install/) or simply run:

```
$ bash -c "$(curl -s https://install.prediction.io/install.sh)"
```

![PIO Install](/images/demo/tapster/pio-install.png)


### Create a New App
You will need to create a new app on PredictionIO to house the Tapster demo. You can do this with:

```
$ pio app new tapster
```

Take note of the App ID and Access Key.

![PIO App New](/images/demo/tapster/pio-app-new.png)

### Setup Engine

We are going to copy the Similar Product Template into the PIO directory.

```
$ cd PredictionIO
$ pio template get PredictionIO/template-scala-parallel-similarproduct tapster-episode-similar
```

Next we are going to update the App ID in the ‘engine.json’ file to match the App ID we just created.

```
$ cd tapster-episode-similar
$ nano engine.json
$ cd ..
```

![Engine Setup](/images/demo/tapster/pio-engine-setup.png)


### Modify  Engine Template

By the default, the engine template reads the “view” events. We can easily to change it to read “like” events.

<!-- For more advanced example of how-to combine view and like/dislike events in one recommender, please see the multi-events-multi-algos.html -->

Modify `readTraining()` in DataSource.scala:

```scala

  override
  def readTraining(sc: SparkContext): TrainingData = {

    ...

    val viewEventsRDD: RDD[ViewEvent] = eventsDb.find(
      appId = dsp.appId,
      entityType = Some("user"),
      eventNames = Some(List("like")), // MODIFIED
      // targetEntityType is optional field of an event.
      targetEntityType = Some(Some("item")))(sc)
      // eventsDb.find() returns RDD[Event]
      .map { event =>
        val viewEvent = try {
          event.event match {
            case "like" => ViewEvent( // MODIFIED
              user = event.entityId,
              item = event.targetEntityId.get,
              t = event.eventTime.getMillis)
            case _ => throw new Exception(s"Unexpected event ${event} is read.")
          }
        } catch {
          case e: Exception => {
            logger.error(s"Cannot convert ${event} to ViewEvent." +
              s" Exception: ${e}.")
            throw e
          }
        }
        viewEvent
      }

    ...
  }
}

```

Finally to build the engine we will run:

```
$ cd tapster-episode-similar
$ pio build
$ cd ..
```

![PIO Build](/images/demo/tapster/pio-build.png)

## Import Data

Once everything is installed, start the event server by running: `$ pio eventserver`

![Event Server](/images/demo/tapster/pio-eventserver.png)

INFO: You can check the status of PredictionIO at any time by running: `$ pio status`

ALERT: If your laptop goes to sleep you might manually need to restart HBase with:

```
$ cd PredictionIO/venders/hbase-0.98.6/bin
$ ./stop-hbase.sh
$ ./start-hbase.sh
```

The key event we are importing into PredictionIO event server is the "Like" event (for example, user X likes episode Y).

We will send this data to PredictionIO by executing `$ rake import:predictionio` command.

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster/blob/master/lib/tasks/import/predictionio.rake)

This script is a little more complex. First we need to connect to the Event Server.

```
client = PredictionIO::EventClient.new(ENV['PIO_ACCESS_KEY'], ENV['PIO_EVENT_SERVER_URL'], THREADS)
```

You will need to create the environmental variables `PIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `PIO_EVENT_SERVER_URL`. The default Event Server URL is: http://localhost:7070.

INFO: If you forget your **Access Key** you can always run: `$ pio app list`

You can set these values in the `.env` file located in the application root directory and it will be automatically loaded into your environment each time Rails is run.

The next part of the script loops through each line of the `data/user_list.csv` file and returns an array of unique user and episode IDs. Once we have those we can send the data to PredictionIO like this.

First the users:

```
user_ids.each_with_index do |id, i|
  # Send unique user IDs to PredictionIO.
  client.aset_user(id)
  puts "Sent user ID #{id} to PredictionIO. Action #{i + 1} of #{user_count}"
end
```

And now the episodes:

```
episode_ids.each_with_index do |id, i|
  # Load episode from database - we will need this to include the categories!
  episode = Episode.where(episode_id: id).take

  if episode
    # Send unique episode IDs to PredictionIO.
    client.acreate_event(
      '$set',
      'item',
      id,
      properties: { categories: episode.categories }
    )
    puts "Sent episode ID #{id} to PredictionIO. Action #{i + 1} of #{episode_count}"
  else
    puts "Episode ID #{id} not found in database! Skipping!".color(:red)
  end
end
```

Finally we loop through the `data/user_list.csv` file a final time to send the like events:

```
CSV.foreach(USER_LIST, headers: true) do |row|
  user_id = row[0] # userId
  episode_id = row[1] # episodeId

  # Send like to PredictionIO.
  client.acreate_event(
    'like',
    'user',
    user_id,
    { 'targetEntityType' => 'item', 'targetEntityId' => episode_id }
  )

  puts "Sent user ID #{user_id} liked episode ID #{episode_id} to PredictionIO. Action #{$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER} of #{line_count}."
end
```

In total the script takes about 4 minutes to run on a basic laptop. At this point all the data is now imported to PredictionIO.

### Engine Training

We train the engine with the following command:

```
$ cd tapster-episode-similar
$ pio train -- --driver-memory 4g
```

![PIO Train](/images/demo/tapster/pio-train.png)

Using the --driver-memory option to limit the memory used by PredictionIO. Without this PredictionIO can consume too much memory leading to a crash. You can adjust the 4g up or down depending on your system specs.

You can set up a job to periodically retrain the engine so the model is updated with the latest dataset.


### Deploy Model

You can deploy the model with: `$ pio deploy` from the `tapster-episode-similar` directory.

At this point, you have an demo app with data and a PredictionIO server with a trained model all setup. Next, we will connect the two so you can log the live interaction (likes) events into PredictionIO event server and query the engine server for recommendation.


## Connect Demo app with PredictionIO

### Overview
On a high level the application keeps a record of each like and dislike. It uses jQuery to send an array of both likes and dislikes to the server on each click. The server then queries PredictionIO for a similar episode which is relayed to jQuery and displayed to the user.

Data flow:

- The user likes an episode.
- Tapster sends the "Like" event to PredictionIO event server.
- Tapster queries PredictionIO engine with all the episodes the user has rated (likes and dislikes) in this session.
- PredictionIO returns 1 recommended episode.

### JavaScript
All the important code lives in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` [View on GitHub](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js)

Most of this file is just handlers for click things, displaying the loading dialog and other such things.

The most important function is to query the Rails server for results from PredictionIO.

```
// Query the server for a comic based on previous likes. See episodes#query.
queryPIO: function() {
  var _this = this; // For closure.
  $.ajax({
    url: '/episodes/query',
    type: 'POST',
    data: {
      likes: JSON.stringify(_this.likes),
      dislikes: JSON.stringify(_this.dislikes),
    }
  }).done(function(data) {
    _this.setComic(data);
  });
}
```
### Rails

On the Rails side all the fun things happen in the episodes controller locates at: `app/controllers/episodes_controller` [View on GitHub](https://github.com/PredictionIO/Demo-Tapster/blob/master/app/controllers/episodes_controller.rb).

```
def query
  # Create PredictionIO client.
  client = PredictionIO::EngineClient.new(ENV['PIO_ENGINE_URL'])

  # Get posted likes and dislikes.
  likes = ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(params[:likes])
  dislikes = ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(params[:dislikes])

  if likes.empty?
    # We can't query PredictionIO with no likes so
    # we will return a random comic instead.
    @episode = random_episode

    render json: @episode
    return
  end

  # Query PredictionIO.
  # Here we black list the disliked items so they are not shown again!
  response = client.send_query(items: likes, blackList: dislikes,  num: 1)

  # With a real application you would want to do some
  # better sanity checking of the response here!

  # Get ID of response.
  id = response['itemScores'][0]['item']

  # Find episode in database.
  @episode = Episode.where(episode_id: id).take

  render json: @episode
end
```

On the first line we make a connection to PredictionIO. You will need to set the `PIO_ENGINE_URL`. This can be done in the `.env` file. The default URL is: http://localhost:8000.

Next we decode the JSON sent from the browser.

After that we check to see if the user has liked anything yet. If not we just return a random episode.

If the user has likes then we can send that data to PredictionIO event server.

We also blacklist the dislikes so that they are not returned.

With our response from PredictionIO it’s just a matter of looking it up in the database and rendering that object as JSON.

Once the response is sent to the browser JavaScript is used to replace the existing comic and hide the loading message.

Thats it. You’re done! If Ruby is not your language of choice check out our other [SDKs](http://docs.prediction.io/sdk/) and remember you can always interact with the Event Server though it’s native JSON API.
