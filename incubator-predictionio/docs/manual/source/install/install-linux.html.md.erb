## Method 1: Quick Install

The above script will complete the installation for you.

## Method 2: Manual Install

If you do not want to use the Quick Install script, you can follow the steps
below to setup PredictionIO and its dependencies. In these instructions we will
assume you are in your home directory. Wherever you see `/home/abc`, replace it
with your own home directory.


### Java

Ensure you have an appropriate Java version installed. For example:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_40"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_40-b25)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.40-b25, mixed mode)
```


### Download PredictionIO

Download PredictionIO and extract it.

```
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/abc
$ wget https://d8k1yxp8elc6b.cloudfront.net/PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```


### Installing Dependencies

Let us install dependencies inside a subdirectory of the PredictionIO
installation. By following this convention, you can use PredictionIO's default
configuration as is.

```
$ mkdir PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors
```


#### Spark Setup

<%= partial 'shared/install/spark' %>


#### Elasticsearch Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are using PostgreSQL or MySQL.

<%= partial 'shared/install/elasticsearch' %>


#### HBase Setup<a class="anchor" name="hbase">&nbsp;</a>

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are using PostgreSQL or MySQL.

<%= partial 'shared/install/hbase' %>


In addition, you must set your environment variable `JAVA_HOME`. For example, in
`/home/abc/.bashrc` add the following line:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
```


<%= partial 'shared/install/dependent_services' %>

Now you have installed everything you need!
