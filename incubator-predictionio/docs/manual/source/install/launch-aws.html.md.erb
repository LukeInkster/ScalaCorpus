title: Launching PredictionIO on AWS
---

Deploying PredictionIO on Amazon Web Services is extremely easy thanks
to AWS Marketplace. As long as you have access to AWS, you can launch a
ready-to-use PredictionIO Amazon EC2 instance with a single click.

## Prerequisites

* Amazon Web Services account
* Amazon EC2

## Access AWS Marketplace

Visit [PredictionIO product's page on AWS
Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00RPIFSYS/) and sign in with
your AWS account.

## Using 1-Click Launch

You should see the following screen after you have logged in.

Under the big yellow "Continue" botton, select the region where you want to
launch the PredictionIO EC2 instance, then click "Continue".

Review your instance's settings before launching. For quick prototyping work,
we recommend using the "memory optimized" instances for the cheapest memory configurations at least the 
"Memory Optimized R3 (r3.large)" or for larger datasets the "(r3.xlarge)".

## Setting Security Group

The default security group, marked by "AutogenByAWSMP", has the following ports
opened to public:

* 22 (SSH)
* 7070 (PredictionIO Event Server)
* 8000 (PredictionIO Server)
* 8080 (Spark Master)
* 9200 (Elasticsearch)

## Start Using PredictionIO

It may take a few minutes after the EC2 instance has launched for all
PredictionIO components to become ready. When they are ready, you may connect to
your instance, see [AWS
documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-connect-to-instance-linux.html)
for more details.

Once you connect to your instance, you can find PredictionIO  at
`/opt/PredictionIO` and the binary command path is `/opt/PredictionIO/bin`.

NOTE: The AWS instance will have all PredictionIO components automatically started for
you, so you could safely skip the **pio-start-all** command as described in QuickStart.
