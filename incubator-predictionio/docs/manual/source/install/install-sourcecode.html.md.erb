---

INFO: Assuming you are following the directory structure in the followoing,
replace `/home/abc` with your own home directory wherever you see it.

## Building

Run the following to download and build PredictionIO from its source code.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO.git
$ cd PredictionIO
$ git checkout master
$ ./make-distribution.sh
```

You should see something like the following when it finishes building
successfully.

```
...
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/sbt/sbt
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/pio-env.sh
PredictionIO binary distribution created at PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

Extract the binary distribution you have just built.

```
$ tar zxvf PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```


## Installing Dependencies

Let us install dependencies inside a subdirectory of the PredictionIO
installation. By following this convention, you can use PredictionIO's default
configuration as is.

```
$ mkdir PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors
```
