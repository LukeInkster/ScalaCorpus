                 [common options...]

Kick off a training using an engine (variant) to produce an engine instance.
This command will pass all pass-through arguments to its underlying spark-submit
command.

  --batch <value>
      Batch label of the run.
  --skip-sanity-check
      Disable all data sanity check. Useful for speeding up training in
      production.
  --stop-after-read
      Stop the training process after DataSource.read(). Useful for debugging.
  --stop-after-prepare
      Stop the training process after Preparator.prepare(). Useful for
      debugging.
  --engine-factory
      Override engine factory class.
  --engine-params-key
      Retrieve engine parameters programmatically from the engine factory class.
  --scratch-uri
      URI of the working scratch space. Specify this when you want to have all
      necessary files transferred to a remote location. You will usually want to
      specify this when you use --deploy-mode cluster.
